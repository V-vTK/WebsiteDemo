# WebsiteDemo
My first attempts at coding a website, 2021

Definitely some things I would do differently and a lot of room for improvement.

1. CSS grid --> Flexbox 
    Flexbox would have been more suited for this project. It avoids a lot of browser support problems.
2. Javascript 
    Functions are quite unpolished and unoptimized.
3. CSS
   CSS would have benefitted from inheritance and cleaner implementation.
4. 3D-object rendering
    Worked earlier now there are some problems with dependencies.

Either way, you have to start somewhere, the end result can be seen [here](https://foxable.cloud/)
The next version will be made using a javascript framework :D
